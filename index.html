<p>So this is the site I plan on using and distributing to allow anyone to easily find information about the big three role playing games: Pathfinder, D&amp;D 3.5 and D&amp;D 5. The newest edition is 5<sup>th</sup> edition. 3.5 is not being updated anymore, so it's data will most likely not change unless a website goes down. Pathfinder is still updating and is considered by some to be a more balanced version of 3.5 and is in fact built off the 3.5 sytem. Most of it's data is open-source whereas the other systems are not. If you are wondering why I am not including 4<sup>th</sup> edition, it's because most people generally considered it rather bad compared to 3.5 due to how they drastically changed how casting and abilities worked. It was just percieved as a generally bad system to the old fans even though it made getting into the system super easy.</p>
